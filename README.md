# Movie Recommendation Using Cosine Similarity

## Formula
### Cosine Similarity
Cosine Similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, representing their similarity:

$$
\text{Cosine Similarity} (A, B) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|\|A\|\| \cdot \|\|B\|\|}
$$

Where:
- $$\( A \cdot B \)$$ is the dot product of vectors A and B
- $$\( \|\|A\|\|)$$ is the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of vector A
- $$\( \|\|B\|\|)$$ is the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of vector B

## Future Improvement
* Using TF-IDF to handle genres more flexibly.
* Combine with another model to improve accuracy recommendation
